# Hi, I'm Mina Ky 👩🏻‍💻

## 💡 CS student at Stanford University
I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence at Stanford. At the same time, I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science on the Human-Computer Interaction Track. I enjoy tackling challenges in Cloud Computing, Fintech, and Human-Centered Product Development.
## 🌱 What Drives Me
I’m fascinated by the intersection of technology and human experiences, aiming to build secure, accessible, and innovative products. I've been abble to explore these interests through various internships in the Finance and Government Sector as a TPM intern at CME Group and SWE intern at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

When I’m not coding, I express my creativity through baking Asian desserts, crafting unique designs with nail art, and reading novels that are movie adaptations.
