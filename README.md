# Hi, I'm Mina Ky 👩🏻‍💻

## 💡 CS student at Stanford University, Specializing in Systems
I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a focus on Systems at Stanford. After taking my first OS class, I became passionate about exploring how complex systems work behind the scenes and designing scalable, secure operating systems. I enjoy tackling challenges in Cloud Computing, Fintech, and Human-Centered Product Development.
## 🌱 What Drives Me
I’m fascinated by the intersection of technology and human experiences, aiming to build secure, accessible, and innovative products. I've been abble to explore these interests through various internships in the Finance and Government Sector as a TPM intern at CME Group and SWE intern at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
### 🍰 Outside of Tech
When I’m not coding, I express my creativity through baking Asian desserts, crafting unique designs with nail art, and reading novels that are movie adaptations.
